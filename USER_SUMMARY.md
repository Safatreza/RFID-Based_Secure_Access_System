# User Summary: ESP32 RFID-Based Secure Access System

## Project Purpose
This project provides a secure, flexible, and extensible access control system using RFID technology. It is designed for learning, prototyping, and real-world deployment with ESP32 and MFRC522 hardware. The system supports persistent authorized UID storage, access feedback, tamper detection, and a master card for easy management.

## File Descriptions
- `src/esp32_rfid_access_control.ino`: Main firmware for ESP32 and MFRC522
- `src/demo_rfid_access_control.ino`: Demo version for logic simulation (no hardware)
- `test/test_rfid_access_control.cpp`: Simulated test cases for demo version
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions
- `USER_MANUAL.md`: User manual, commands, and troubleshooting
- `USER_SUMMARY.md`: This summary and code explanations

## Major Code Blocks & Functions
- **Pin Definitions & Config:** All GPIO assignments are at the top for easy changes.
- **EEPROM Layout:** Defines how UIDs are stored persistently.
- **setupRFID():** Initializes SPI and MFRC522 module.
- **loadAuthorizedUids():** Loads UIDs from EEPROM (main) or mock list (demo).
- **checkUID():** Checks if a scanned UID is authorized.
- **addUidToEEPROM()/addUidToList():** Adds a new UID to EEPROM or mock list.
- **grantAccess()/denyAccess():** Controls LEDs and buzzer (main) or prints status (demo).
- **printUID():** Prints UID to serial for debugging.
- **blinkRedLedRapidly()/simulateTamper():** Handles tamper detection feedback.
- **Main Loop:**
  - Checks for tamper event
  - Waits for RFID card
  - Prints UID
  - Handles master card logic for adding new UIDs
  - Grants/denies access and provides feedback

## Firmware Structure Rationale
- **Modular Functions:** Each logical operation is a function for clarity and maintainability.
- **Section Headers & Comments:** Guide the user and make code easy to navigate.
- **Mock/Demo Support:** Enables logic testing without hardware.
- **Test Cases:** Validate logic and edge cases for robust development.
- **Easy Customization:** Pin assignments and UIDs are at the top of each file.
